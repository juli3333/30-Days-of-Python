My experience with the 30 Days of Python challenge is available in this repository. It covers a new Python concept every day, progressing from the fundamentals for beginners to more complex subjects like object-oriented programming, modules, and working with APIs.


Purpose: To strengthen my Python programming skills, to build a strong foundation for future projects and to practice consistency and daily learning habits.

Topics Covered:
Variables, data types, and operators

Conditional statements and loops

Functions and modules

Data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)

File handling

Error handling

Regular expressions

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Working with JSON and APIs

Data analysis basics (Pandas, NumPy)
